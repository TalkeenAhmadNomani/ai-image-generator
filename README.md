# AI-Powered Text-to-Image Generator
A MERN stack web application that converts text prompts into AI-generated images using NLP-based processing and Hugging Face models. Users can generate, view, download, and manage their AI-generated images, which are stored securely in Cloudinary. The app features a clean and responsive Tailwind CSS UI for an enhanced user experience. The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js and follows an async/await pattern for efficient asynchronous operations.

##  Features
📝 Text-to-Image Generation: Uses NLP to process text prompts and generate images via Hugging Face models.
☁️ Cloudinary Storage: Securely stores generated images for easy access and retrieval.
⬇️ Download Functionality: Users can download generated images directly.
🎨 Modern UI: Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive design.
